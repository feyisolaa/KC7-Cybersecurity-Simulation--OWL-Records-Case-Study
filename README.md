# KC7-Cybersecurity-Simulation--OWL-Records-Case-Study
Cybersecurity simulation project based on the KC7 platform. Investigated phishing, log analysis, reconnaissance, and incident response in a case study scenario for OWL records
## Project Overview
This project is based on the **KC7 cybersecurity Simulation**, designed for first-time players with no prior experience required.
I took on the role of a **Security Analyst for OWL Records**, tasked with protecting the company's sensitive information during an ongoing feud between two artists.

Through this simulation, I practiced identifying, analyzing, and responding to stimulated cyber threats such as **phishing, social engineering, and dark web reconnaissance**

## Objectives
- Identify elements of a phishing campaign
- Interpret security logs to detect evidence of malicious activity
- Investigate and respond to a bsic cybersecurity intrusion
- Conduct reconnaissance through simulated **social media** and **dark web** monitoring

---
## Tools and Techniques
- **Phishing Detection** - spotting red flags in malicious emails
- **Log Analysis** - examining system logs for signs of intrusion
- **Reconnaissance** - gatering intelligence from open-source data and dark web forums
- **Incident Response** - applying structured investigation methods

  ---

  ## Key Findings
  - discovered indicators of compromise (IoCs) linked to phishing attempts targeting OWL Records staff
  - Traced malicious activities through log data to uncover suspicious account access
  - Identified sensitive information at risk of being exposed on underground forums
  - Implemented mitigation strategies to safeguard the organization's digital assets

    ## Skills Gained
  - Threat detection & response
  - Security Information & Events Management (SIEM)-style log interpretation
  - Digital forensics basics
  - Threat intelligence & social engineering awareness
  - Incident response methodology

  ## Lessons Learned
  - Even seemingly harmless social media activity can epxose valuable data.
  - Phishing attacks remain one of the most common entry points for cyber intrusions
  - Log data provides crucial insights when investigating potential breaches.
  - Reconnaissance on the dark web is essential to understand threat actor behaviors.
